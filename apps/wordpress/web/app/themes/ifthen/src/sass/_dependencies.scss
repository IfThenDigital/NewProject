// Dependencies
// This file imports other sass files that contain
// variables or mixins from both this theme and 3rd
// parties like Foundation. This file can then be imported
// into component files, so that they can become namespaced
// and still have access to global mixins, vars, etc.

// Required Bootstrap
@import "~bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/mixins";

// Optional Bootstrap
@import "~bootstrap/scss/reboot";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/dropdown";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/tables";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/helpers/visually-hidden";

// Sass variables, mixins, maps, etc
@import "settings";

// extends, functions, and mixins
@import "utilities";

// Typography
@import "fonts";
@import "typography";
